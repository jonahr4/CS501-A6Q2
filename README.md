# Compass & Digital Level (Q2)

Compose UI that combines a compass and digital level using device sensors.

- Magnetometer + accelerometer compute compass heading; a rotated needle graphic points north.
- Gyroscope drives roll/pitch readouts for the level view so tilt is easy to see.
- Canvas/Image rotation animates smoothly for a playful, colorful UI.
- Helpful for orientation checks and quick leveling tasks.
